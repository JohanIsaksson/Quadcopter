3) Plug in your cable to TX and turn on Tx.
4) Plug USB cable into PC (you should have already completed the driver install)
5) Select your com port (a new com port would have been added during the driver install)

T6config does NOT like com ports higher than com 9. 
If your USB driver selects com9, then find the USB device in hardware manager 
and go to the properties section and change the com port.

Save your settings to a default file so you can come back to it.
Do not keep saving the same file name, you want to be able to revert back to a previous file if you mess something up. Name them incrementally Blueray1, Blueray2, etc.
My default file is particular to MY helicopter, Your Endpoints and Subtrims are likely to be different.
